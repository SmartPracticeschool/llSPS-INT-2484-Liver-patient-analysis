## Liver Disease Prediction System <br>
Diagnosis of liver disease at a preliminary stage is important for better treatment. It is a very challenging task for medical researchers to predict the disease in the early stages owing to subtle symptoms To overcome this issue, this project aims to improve liver disease diagnosis using machine learning approaches. The main objective of this research is to use classification algorithms to identify the liver patients from healthy individuals.
